# 7.8 Level 80 Gearing Guide

## Step 1: Get to 80

If you're confident you can hit 80 within a particular week, **try NOT to run any of the weekly veteran missions**. You want to run these *after* you hit 80 in order to get **FP-1 Stabilizers**.

**FP-1 Stabilizers** and **Tech Fragments** are special currencies that you will need to gear up. The Stabilizers DO NOT DROP until you hit 80.

## Step 2: Legendary Implants Mission

After you hit 80, a Twilek NPC named Lonndar Eadwinn will have a mission called **Technological Advancements** which has you complete any of a variety activies to build up 100 charges on a ring.

Vetern FPs give you 8 per run, so once you're geared (Step 3), just run the Weekly Veteran missions, and it should fill up quickly.

Once you hit 100/100 on the mission and turn it in, a droid named SN-4RK will appear. He sells 326 Implants that cost 100 Conquest Commendations, 6500 Tech Fragments, *and* 25,000 credits. Look up your class + discipline to determine which implants are best for you.

SN-4RK will also upgrade your implants for the same cost, 2 iLevels at a time. A 340 implant will cost 800 Conquest Commendations, 52,000 Tech Fragments, and 200,000 credits.

## Step 3: Acquire a Blue 324 Item

If you don't have a blue 324 piece, purchase one piece of ***BLUE* 324 gear** from Corcris Stawkit for 60 FP-1 Stabilizers and 34,650 credits. We recommend the Ear piece, but anything that costs 60 FP-1 Stabilizers *AND IS BLUE* will do.

You will upgrade this piece at Jeela Dine for 170 FP-1 Stabilizers and 69,300 credits, 2 iLevels at a time, until it is 340. It costs 1,360 FP-1 Stabilizers and 554,400 credits in total. *This* is why you want to wait to do the Weekly Veteran missions until you're 80.

## Step 4: Get *Almost* All 324 Gear

In addition to you 324 blue item, you need 324+ gear pieces in *almost* all of your slots. The easiest way is to buy green 324 pieces from Kyla Tane in exchange Conquest Commendations. HOWEVER—

Before you buy from her, you will want **one piece of gear that is BELOW 320**. A lower level Relic is recommended here, but as long as you have something under 320 this will work.

The sub-320 item will leverage the game's loot bias to get you three to four blue 324 items from Veteran FP bosses which you can deconstruct for 10 FP-1 Stabilizers each. If you have all 324 gear, only green items will drop that yield only 1 Stabilizer.

## Step 5: Tacticals

Visit Morro the Reaper to pick up a Tactical drive for 3,000 Tech Fragments and 1,000,000 credits. Look up your class + discipline to determine which Tactical is best for your role.

## Step 6: Unlocking 340 Mods

After you get your blue item upgraded to 340, head over to Hyde and pick up the **340 Prototype** mission. He will ask you to deconstruct a blue 340 item. ***MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE MISSION BEFORE YOU DECONSTRUCT.***

After you deconstruct and turn the mission in, Zeek will now sell you 340 mods for 100,000 credits each. You can look up your role/class to determine which stats you need to prioritize.

## Step 7: Build Your 340 Gear

You will need to find gear that has open modification slots.

- Weapons and off-hands will have a Hilt or Barrel slot, Modification slot, and Enhancement slot.
- Head, Chest, Hands, Legs and Feet will have an Armoring slot, Modification slot, and Enhancement slot.
- Waist and Wrists will have an Armoring slot and a Modification slot.

Overall you will need to buy a combination of 25 different mods in your equipment. By slotting all 340 mods in a piece of gear, it will become item level 340.

You will need to replace the blue item you deconstructed for Hyde and continue to level up your Ear, Implants and Relics until they are also 340.
